## Purpose

I started this repository so I could track my journey through Rust, from merely knowing about it to being able to complete
the projects described at "The book". As a software engineer I am constantly concern with performance and whats coming next,
as soon as I heard about some results people were obtaining with Rust, I knew I had to at least take a glance.

Also at the time I started this repo I was working on my degrees thesis which required working with WASM, which Rust is great with.


## Take a glance!

Please feel free to read my notes as I went through the book, I tried to make them as understandable as I could and funny enough so
I wouldn't fall asleep while reading them.
