---- Slice Type

Like python lets you reference a series of contiguous elements in a collection
rather than the whole thing.


let s = String::from("hello world");
let hello = &s[..5];
let world = &s[6..];

let s = "Hello" is a stirng literal, s will be of the type &s and is immutable
given that &s are immutable references.

if we want functions to be able to take stirng literals and normal strings
the type of the function paramenter should be &str as it supports both of them
and not only strings like &String


we can slice other things such as arrays like the following

let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let slice = &a[..3];


---- Structs
