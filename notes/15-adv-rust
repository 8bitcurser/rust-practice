---- Unsafe rust

Allows:

* deference a raw pointer
* call an unsafe function or method
* access or modify a mutable static variable
* implement unsafe traits

using unsafe on a block, still checks for borrows and does all safety checks
the only difference is that enables those 4 things.

A good practice is wrapping unsafe code in a safe block and give it access 
through a safe API.


--- deference a raw pointer

safe rust ensures references are valid always, unsafe rust on the other hand
allows the existance of "raw pointers", they can be mut or inmut and are 
written like

*const T
*mut T

[* doesnt stand for deference it is part of the type name]

in this context immutable means it can be directly assigned after being 
deferenced.


raw pointers are allowed to

> skip borrowing rules by having immutable and 
mutable pointers or mutiple mutable pointers to the same location.

> they may not point to valid memory

> may be null

> they are not automatically cleaned up

we could use them to obtain a greater performance or for interacting with 
things rust usually doesnt apply like OS, languages, hardware, etc.


e.g

let mut num = 5;

let r1 = &num as *cons i32;
let r2 = &num as *mut i32;

// we didnt need to mark as unsafe as raw pointers are allowed in safe code.
// but they can not be deferenced


in this case the reference comes from another one, so the ref is ok and will
work

let address = 0x012345usize;
let r = address as *const i32;

this will explode if we try to do something fishy with it as the address is
invalid

let mut num = 5;

// without raw pointers this wouldn't have compiled as rust does not allow
// mut and immut references to the same data to coexist as they may introduce
// race conditions
let r1 = &num as *cons i32;
let r2 = &mut num as *mut i32;

// we need the unsafe block to deference them
unsafe {
    println!("r1 is {}", *r1);
    println!("r2 is {}", *r2);    
}

this is usually used when interfacing with C or when building safe abstractions


--- calling unsafe function or method

prefixing a function with unsafe indicates that some unsafe magic might be 
going on inside and we read its doc and we are ok with it, but to call them we
need to wrap them in an unsafe block

e.g.

unsafe fn dangerous() {}

unsafe {
    dangerous();
}


--- safe abstraction over unsafe code

its common practice that we may wrap unsafe function inside a safe wrapper,
this means the function may execute an unsafe block within it but the overall
function is safe to use and be called without needing to wrap it again (the
call) inside an unsafe block, this is the case of the split_at_mut which uses
raw pointers to slice a vector in two parts and returns a vector for each 
part, the unsafe block exists inside the method and for the user its safe and
transparent

--- using extern functions to call external code

the extern keyword allows the creation and use of FFI (foreign function
interface) which allows us to define methods that other languages might call,
functions declares with an extern are always unsafe as they do not have and
provide the data safe garantees of rust.

e.g


// the "C" is an ABI (application binary interface) it defines how to call
// the function at assembly level, this is the most common and refers to the 
// C lang
extern "C" {
    fn abs(input: i32) -> i32;
}


fn main(){
    unsafe {
        println!("Absolute value of -3 according to C: {}", abs(-3));
    }
}

--- accesing or modifying a mutable static variable

global variables aka static variables

e.g
// they get a static mem addr, diff to constants which are duplicated when the
// data is used. also constants can be mutated while statics yes, but its 
// unsafe
static HELLO_WORLD: &str = "Hello World";
fn main() {
    println!("name is {}", HELLOW_WORLD);
}


e.g 2

static mut COUNTER: u32 = 0;
fn add_to_count(inc: u32) {
    unsafe {
        COUNTER += inc;
    }
}

fn main(){
    add_to_count(3);
    // either reading and writing happens at the unsafety
    unsafe {
        println!("COUNTER: {}", COUNTER);
    }
}



--- implementing unsafe traits.


unsafe traits are those that have at least one of its methods with variants 
that cant be verified


unsafe trait Foo {
    //
}

unsafe impl Foo for i32 {
    // bleah
}

this would be the case if some method from the trait uses raw pointers then
the whole trait should be unsafe.


---- Placeholder Type in Trait defintions with associated Types.

It allows one to define a type inside the trait definition which can be used
in one of the method definition signatures.


e.g
put trait Iterator {
    // place holder type
    type Item;
    // signature using the type.
    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item>;
}

this associated types are similar to generics


comparisson examaple:
=======
placeholder type.

impl Iterator for Counter {
    type Item = u32;
    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {
        // ...
    }
}

=======
generics

pub trait Iterator<T> {
    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<T>;
}


the difference between them is that every time we implement the generic version
we have to annotate the types for each implementation as the Generic could be
whatever. This allows the type that implements the trait with generic parameters
to implement it for multiple different types, when using the next method on 
counter we will need to write type annotations to let the compiler know which
implementation are we going to use.


associated types are more specific when it comes to this, we dont need to 
annotate the type cause we already set it at the place holder type, it will
return whatever we define type to be on the implmementation and as we cant
implement the trait multiple times on a type,
 so it will exist only one implementation.

--- default generic type parameters and operator overloading.

generics may have a default type by doing <PlaceHolderType=ConcreteType>

This is used on operator overloading, which is customizing the behaviour of an
operator such as +.

Rust blocks the capability of creating custom operators or overloading 
arbitrary operators. Those one std::ops are overloadable if the corresponding
trait is implemented.

e.g

use std::ops::Add;

#[derivce(Debug, PartialEq)]
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32
}


impl Add for Point {
    type Output = Point;
    fn add(self, other: Point) -> Point {
        Point {
            x: self.x + other.x,
            y: self.y + other.y
        }

    }
}


fn main() {
    assert_eq!(Point: {x: 1, y: 0} + Point {x: 2, y: 3},
               Point {x: 3, y: 3});
}


how Add looks in the standard lib


// default type parameter
// the defult will be self and self is the type in which we are implementing
// the trait
trait Add<RHS=Self> {
    type Output;
    fn add(self, rhs: RHS) -> Self::Output;
}


a case where we specify a special RHS

use std::ops::Add;

struct Millimeters(u32);
struct Meters(u32);

// setting rhs
impl Add<Meters> for Millimeters {
    type Output = Millimeters;

    fn add(self, other: Meters) -> Millimeters {
        Millimeters(self.0 + (other.0 * 1000))
    }
}


--- syntax for disambiguation: call methods with the same name


two traits might have the a method with the same name, in those cases we need
to tell rust which we want to use if both are implmented at the same type.


trait Pilot {
    fn fly(&self);
}


trait Wizard {
    fn fly(&self);
}

struct Human;

impl Pilot for Human {
    fn fly(&self) {
        println!(This is your captain speaking!");
    }
}


impl Wizard for Human {
    fn fly(&self) {
        println!("Up!");
    }
}


impl Human {
    fn fly(&self) {
        println!("*Shake arms like a chicken*);
    }
}


fn main() {
    let person = Human;
    // this will call the fly that was implemented on the type as is the 
    // default behavior to call the ones of the traits we need to be specific
    person.fly();
    Pilot::fly(&person);
    Wizard::fly(&person);
    Human::fly(&person); // would have done the same as line 347
}


-- case with associated fn on traits

associated functions of tratis do not have the self parameters passed on to
them, if two types implement the same trait and this trait has an associated 
function and both types implement the function rust can not know which one of
them call the function thats why we need to use fully qualified syntax.

e.g


trait Animal {
    // associated function
    fn baby_name() -> String;
}

struct Dog;

impl Dog {
    fn baby_name() -> String {
        String::from("spot")
    }
}

impl Animal for Dog {
    fn baby_name() -> String {
        String::from("puppy")
    }
}


fn main() {
    // this will print Spot which is not gooda
    // we cant do Anima::baby_name as it is an asscoiated function and not a
    // method so it doesnt have "self"
    println!("A baby dog is called a {}", Dog::baby_name());
    // this removes the ambiguity and tells rust it wants to use the baby name
    // method implementation from the animal trait the dog type.
    println!("A baby dog is called a {}", <Dog as Animal>::baby_name());
}


fully_qualified syntax = <Type as Trait>::function(receiver_if_method, args..)

receiver is in the case this was not an associated function


-- Super trait, require a functionality of another trait to implement ones
   trait


use std::fmt;

// my trait requires the implementation of the display trait in order to work
// and the method_x function to run.

trait MyTrait: fmt::Display {
    fn method_x(&self) {
        // ...
    }
}

struct Bleh {}

// this will explode as Display hasn't been implemented for Bleh
// impl MyTrait for Bleh {}
impl fmt::Display for Bleh {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
        write!(f, "Bleh");
    }
}



// now we can do

impl MyTrait for Bleh {}


-- new type pattern to implement ext traits on ext types

previously we saw that either the type or the trait must be local to the crate
in order to use something external, the new type pattern is a workaround to
this, this pattern creates a new type within a tuple struct.
This way we wrapp the new type within a local type

the tuple struct has one field and is a thin wrapper around the type, and now
we may implement the trait to the wrapper.

this pattern has no runtime overhead, and the wrapper type is elided(ommited)
at compile time


use std::fmt;

struct Wrapper(Vec<String>);

impl fmt::Display for Wrapper {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
       write!(f, "[{}]", self.0.join(", "))
    }
}

fn main() {
    let w = Wrapper(vec![String::from("hello"), String::from("world")]);
    println!("w = {}", w);
}

the downside is Wrapper is a type and therefor it doesnt have the methods from
the inner type, to have them we have to implement them manually. A workaround
this would be implementing the Deref trait on wrapper as to return the inner
type on the wrapper.


--- Advance types

-- newtype pattern for type safety and abstracion

if we implement two types that wrap a u32, and we make a function that takes
the first type this function will never accept a plain u32 or the second type,
making it safe.


wrapping can also make for a safer api, by wrapping we can pick what we trully
expose while keeping the inner type private with its methods, this pattern
its neat for encapsulation


--- type aliasing

rust allows one to give a type another name.

// we are aliasing i32 to Kilometers
type Kilometers = i32;

when we declare a var with the type kilometers it will be treated the same as 
if it was an i32.

its commonly used to remove lengthy type names such as 

Box<dyn Fn() + Send + 'static>

type Thunk = Box<dyn Fn() + Send + 'static>

let f: Thunk = Box::new(|| println!("Hi"));

also commonly used with Result<T, E>

e.g


use std::io::Error;
use std::fmt;

pub trait Write {
    fn write(&mut self, buf: &[u8]) -> Result<usize, Error>;
    fn flush(&mut self) -> Result<(), Error>;
    fn write_all(&mut self, buf: &[u8]) -> Result<(), Error>;
    fn write_fmt(&mut self, fmt: fmt::Arguments) -> Result<(), Error>;
}

type Result<T> = Result<T, std::io::Error>;

// this will simplify it this way

pub trait Write {
    fn write(&mut self, buf: &[u8]) -> Result<usize>;
    fn flush(&mut self) -> Result<()>;
    fn write_all(&mut self, buf: &[u8]) -> Result<()>;
    fn write_fmt(&mut self, fmt: fmt::Arguments) -> Result<()>;
}

Boila less code!


--- the ! type

this is the empty type which has no values, in rust is called the "never type"
fn bar() -> ! {
}
its kinda equivalent to void, functions that return the never type are called
divergent functions

in match expressions we see this when if nothing is matched we may execute 
a panic!, rust sees the ! and knows that that arm wont return anything and the
proper return is the other arm.



--- dynamically sized types

DST or unsized types, are types which we can not know the final size in 
compile time only in runtime, one of this examples is str

DSTs pointers store the starting position and the length of the slice (in the 
case of &str) so the &str is actually two values the addr to the str and its 
length. 

DSTs have an extra bit of metadata that stores the size of the dynamic info

golden rule:

"For DST type we must put values of dynamically sized types behind a pointer of
some kind" so a str can be paired with any pointer type such as Box and Rc. 

Traits are also DST that we refer by name, when we create trait objects we 
create them writing &dyn Trait or Box<dyn Trait> that is puting the type behid
the data.


So DST have this particularity where we kinda dont know their size right away
so rust implements a trait Sized to determine whether a types size is known or
not. The trait is automatically implemented for anything which size is known
during compilation. This is also implmented on every generic function (meaning
it uses generic parameters) meaning it will only work with arguments of a known
size but we can relax this restriction by doing


// notice that t: is a &T as we dont know its size we must put it behind a 
// pointer
fn generic <T: ?Sized>(t: &T) {} this sintax is ONLY available for Sized.


--- Adv functions and closures.

-- function pointers

they allow one to pass a function as a parameter to another function


e.g.

// functins coerce to the type fn <- this is called a function pointer
// fn types implement the three clousure traits Fn, FnMut, FnOnce
fn add_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x+1
}

fn do_twice(f: fn(i32) -> i32, arg: i32) -> i32 {
    f(arg) + f(arg)
}


fn main() {
    let answer = do_twice(add_one, 5);
    println!("Called a function twice!");
}


as function pointers implmeent the three clousure traits we can pass it to
functions that expect a closure. Its best to write a function using a gen type
and one of the clousure traits so the function can accept either funcion or
clousures.

cases where we want fn rather than clousures is when interfacing with languages
that do not have clousures like C


clousures vs fn


let list of numbers = vec![1, 2, 3];
let list_of_strings: Vec<String> = list_of_numbers
    .iter
    .map(|i| i.to_string())
    .collect();


or

let list_of_strings: Vec<String> = list_of_numbers
    .iter()
    // fully qualified syntax
    .map(ToString::to_string())
    .collect();


both are valid and it depneds on the style of the coder.


- exploiting tuple structs and tuple struct enums.

this tuple like types use () as an initializer, similar to a fn call. The 
initializers are actually functions that return a type with the data.
This initializers can be used as function pointers that implement the clousure
traits. This means we can use the initializer functions as args for methods that
take clousures


enum Status {
    Value(u32),
    Stop
}


let list_of_statuses: Vec<Status> = 
    (0u32..20)
    // we create a bunch of instances of the type Status::Value that take
    // each value inside the range of the initializer, this sintax is pretty
    // neat but not that verbose
    .map(Status::Value)
    .collect();


-- Returning Clousures

clousures are represented by traits therefor we can just return them. Usually
to do it we return the type that implements them but clousures have no 
specific type, so what we do is returning a dynamic type that implements the
trait that makes a clousure be a clousure as

fn returns_clousure() -> Box<dyn Fn(i32) -> i32> {
    Box::new(|x| x + 1)
}

--- Macros

Macros are code that generate code, in a way metaprogramming.

there are 3 types of procedural macros

. custom macros (used on struct on enums with the #[derive] key)
. attribute like macros (this define custom attrs on any item)
. function like macros (this work like functions calls but work on
                        specific tokens)

macros are useful to reduce the amount of code that needs to be generated,
macros can take a variable number of parameters (different to functions where 
we have to specify its amount) 

e.g println!("hello")  or println!("{}", name);

macros are expanded before the compiler interprets the meaning of the code so
it can implement a trait on a type, a function cant do this because it gets
called on runtime (traits are implemented during compile time).


the downside of macros against functions is the increase in complexity when it
comes to writing and maintaining them.

Macros also MUST be declared before they are used, different to functions that 
we can declares wherever.

macros in rust also compare a value to a pattern, but in this cade the value
is the code written in rust, the patterns are compared to the structure fo the 
source code and the code associated to each pattern, when the match occurs
the macro replaces that "value" with the new code. 

this type of macro which are called 'declarative macros'

e.g
// vec is the declarative macro 
let v: Vec<u32> = vec![1, 2, 3];

an implementation of vec is kindaaa like this

// means this should be made available whenver the crate that has the macro
// defined is brought to scope.
#[macro_export]
macro_rules! vec {
    // expr is a match all, then it comes the , and the * means all the
    // repetitions of it
        // everything inside the $() is the pattern
    ( $( $x: expr ), * ) => {
        let mut temp_vec = Vec::new();
            // for each match of the pattern, do this.
            $(
                temp_vec.push($x);
            )*
        }
    };

}


-- procedural macros generate code from attr

accept code as input operate on that and ouput code, this does not match a 
pattern and replace code. 

procedural macros exist within their own crate which is of an special kind.

e.g

use proc_macro;


#[some_attr]
pub fn some_name(input: TokenStream) -> TokenStream {}


a good use for this type of macros si when we commonly implement X trait on a
series of types, this can become hard to maintain and trouble some at times.
For this scenario we may generate a macro that implements that trait for us.

check macro_trait project

implementing a procedural macro for crate foo, requires us to create a special
lib crate named foo_derive which should be inside the foo crate

this structure allos users to implement the lib without the macro if they do
not require it, but the downside is if we want to implement both we gotta
add both to our cargo toml file, we could make foo import foo_derive and re 
export foo_derive but it will force users to implement both of them even if
they do not want it, the foo derive at the Cargo.toml must have a new section
called [lib] and under it the proc-macro attribute = true.


-- attribute like macros

kinda like derive macros but instead of generating code they allow the creation
of new attrs, and more flex. derive works only for structs and enums but this
ones can go with anything like functions.

e.g

// by the framework it would be a procedural macro
#[route(GET, "/")]
fn index(){}


in the framework it would look like this

// the first TokenStream goes for the content of the attr (the GET)
// the second is the body of the item the attr is attached to which is the 
// signature and function body
pub fn route(attr: TokenStream, item: TokenStream) -> TokenStream {}

to use them you gotta do the same create a proc-macro crate type and implement
a function that generates the code needed.


-- function like macros

they are like functions but more flexible and can take an undefine number of 
arguments, the difference to the first kind of macros we talked about is that
they take a TokenStream parameter which is manipulated 

e.g.

let sql = sql!("SELECT * FROM post WHERE id=1"0;

this will take the statement and check its valid, this is way more complex than
what macro_rules! can do (the first kind)

#[proc_macro]
pub fn sql(input: TokenStream) -> TokenStream {... bleh}
